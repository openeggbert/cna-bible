# Next session — start here

Read this file, then `PLAN.md`, then `AUDIT.md`. The raw per-area research evidence is in
`audit/` (ten files). CNA-side defects found along the way are in `cnabugs.md`. The previous
edition's plan and handoff are archived as `PLAN-ARCHIVE-2026-07-26.md` and
`NEXT-ARCHIVE-2026-07-26.md` — history, not instructions.

## State at handoff (2026-08-12)

| | |
|---|---|
| cna-bible branch | `next`; local commits are ahead of `origin/next` (push requires explicit external-publication approval) |
| CNA pinned SHA | `7a64362efef4119bf880459ef1704fb2c52199e2` (`develop` == `origin/develop`, 2026-08-11) |
| Book builds | **yes** — 683 pages, all automated checks green; Phase D batches 1–4 visually verified |
| Phase | **A, B, and C complete. Phase D in progress:** four verified batches, Chapters 19–54, are complete. |

## What is done

1. **Source baseline pinned**, read-only throughout — CNA and every sibling repository were only
   ever read, never built, checked out, reset, or fixed. `PLAN.md` §2 has all eleven sibling HEADs.
2. **Phase A source audit is complete.** All ten research areas delivered full reports, now on
   disk in `audit/`:
   - `architecture-build.md` — identity, module system, build system, renderer selection
   - `renderer-catalog.md` — all 46 renderer identities, one profile each
   - `graphics-core-effects.md` — GraphicsDevice, resources, state objects, effects, shaders
   - `content-xnb-cnj.md` — ContentManager, XNB container, type readers, CNJ format
   - `3d-gltf-cnj.md` — Model runtime, glTF importer, skinning, the CNJ toolchain
   - `testing-verification.md` — test infrastructure, oracles, CI, the 56-script catalog
   - `input-audio-net-services.md` — input, devices/sensors, audio, media, net, GamerServices,
     Avatar, storage
   - `platforms.md` — Linux/Windows/Wine/Proton/Emscripten/Android/macOS state matrix
   - `sibling-libraries.md` — sharp-runtime, easy-gl, meta-gl, free-direct, free-api
   - `framework-core-math.md` — exact Game lifecycle order, math/core type semantics
3. **`AUDIT.md`** is the curated cross-report matrix and contradiction log. Its §4 has the
   headline conclusions from every area, cited back to the raw reports.
4. **`cnabugs.md`** records 54 genuine CNA-side defects found during the audit, in English, for
   upstream triage. CNA was never patched — this is a record, not a fix.
5. **Verification tooling added.** `tools/verify-book.sh` runs build + reference/label/index/
   stale-term/whitespace checks in one pass; `tools/render-pages.sh FIRST LAST` drives the visual
   PNG pass a log grep cannot replace.
6. **All 112 hard-coded chapter references migrated to `\ref{}`** (two styles: `Chapter~N`,
   `Ch.N`). This had to happen before any restructuring could safely begin.
7. **Part IV's taxonomy and draw-path evidence are settled** — see `PLAN.md` §4 and
   `audit/renderer-draw-path-matrix.md`: eight clusters partition all 46 renderer identities
   exactly (10+4+7+9+6+4+3+3 = 46, checked), and all 42 implementation families now have
   effect-aware draw, RT2D, MRT and occlusion-query behavior mapped from source.
8. **Phase B is complete.** `PLAN.md` §4 settles a 12-Part / 79-chapter / 8-appendix TOC, gives
   every chapter a depth band and evidence remit, and maps every old Ch.01–49 to its new home.
   Content, 3D/glTF and Testing/Verification now have dedicated Parts; Math and Devices split;
   sharp-runtime expands to six chapters; the free-direct library material merges into one
   chapter distinct from CNA's `FREEDIRECT` renderer treatment.
9. **Phase C is complete and verified.** The filesystem and `main.tex` now
   contain exactly 12 Parts, Ch.01–79 and Appendices A–H. Every old label survived; every new
   chapter has a semantic label; all old prose remains compiled. Chapters not yet reached by
   Phase D remain honest structural placeholders. The old Vulkan/WebGPU/SDL GPU material was
   preserved together under the native-modern chapter and was integrated in Phase D batch 1.
10. **The edition-wide terminology and path migration is complete.** The live manuscript uses
    current renderer/CNAEXT identifiers and selectors, distinguishes `FREEDIRECT` from
    `DIRECTX3`, leads with the authoritative **46 identities / 42 implementation families**
    registry, keeps “backend” only for real service/platform backends, and cites CNA files under
    their `modules/<owner>/…` paths. Every explicit module file citation was existence-checked
    against the pin. The sweep also corrected Storage's current boundary: five `StorageDevice`
    tests exist; `StorageContainer` remains untested.
11. **The renderer draw-path divergence matrix is complete.** Thirty-one families override both
    ordinary `Draw*Ex` methods and eleven inherit both; DIRECTX10 is the sole unconditional
    inherited colored downgrade. Four override families retain conditional colored tails.
    RT2D/MRT/occlusion behavior is mapped separately from capability claims, exposing the further
    default-true contradictions recorded as CNA-BUG-054.
12. **Phase D batch 1 is complete and verified.** Chapters 19–27 now cover the renderer
    contract and selection, all ten OpenGL identities, the four native-modern identities, all
    seven abstraction-layer identities, and the nine historical DirectX/Glide identities.
    The consolidated book is 661 pages; physical pages 194–303 were rendered and inspected.
13. **Phase D batch 2 is complete and verified.** Chapters 28–32 finish all renderer clusters;
    Chapters 33–36 split the ContentManager façade, XNB container, XNB object graph, and CNJ
    format at their real implementation seams. Physical pages 304–391 were all inspected.
14. **Phase D batch 3 is complete and verified.** Chapters 37–45 now cover content robustness,
    all four model routes, the shared glTF importer, stride ABI, skinning/animation, CNJ toolchain,
    the five implemented oracle layers, current Input facts and current SDL3_mixer/XACT behavior.
    The consolidated book is 675 pages; physical pages 392–455 were all inspected.
15. **Phase D batch 4 is complete and verified.** Chapters 46–54 now cover the Media layer's
    real codec and ownership boundaries; SDL/Android sensor delivery; the optional CNA.Devices
    host seam; local GamerServices identity and persistence; Storage containment asymmetry;
    session delivery, discovery and hostile-input behavior; Avatar's inert API and rendered EXT
    path; sharp-runtime's honest object model; and its current 44-component CNA consumption seam.
    The consolidated book is 683 pages. Physical pages 456–523 were inspected as eight full
    contact sheets plus a tail sheet; component tables, link closures and long include paths were
    checked at full size. That zoomed pass found and corrected two overflowing include paths in
    Chapter 54, after which the full build and affected-page render were repeated.

## Do this next

**Continue Phase D with Chapters 55–63** as the next nine-chapter batch: finish the remaining
sharp-runtime chapters (object model, namespaces, parity, verification), rebuild easy-gl/meta-gl
and free-direct/free-api from the sibling audit, then begin the platform Part with the
cross-platform contract and both Windows chapters. Read `audit/sibling-libraries.md` and
`audit/platforms.md` before writing, then run one consolidated build and visual pass.

## Do not do these

- **Do not reopen Phase C casually.** Structural, label, terminology, selector, and path migration
  is complete; Phase D owns substantive prose changes.
- **Do not modify CNA or any sibling repository.** Defects found are recorded in `cnabugs.md` and
  `AUDIT.md` §5.1 for upstream reporting, never patched from here.
- **Do not trust the old `PLAN-ARCHIVE`/`NEXT-ARCHIVE` per-chapter page targets or their
  "PDF-verified clean" labels.** They were verified against a CNA state that no longer exists.
- **Do not quote any count from a CNA `docs/*.md` or `plan_*.md`.** See `PLAN.md` §5 for the ten
  standing rules this edition follows, including which CNA documents are known-stale and why.
- **Do not treat a green LaTeX log as sufficient verification.** Proven this session: a
  doubled-backslash `\ref` passed every automated check (no error, no warning, no undefined
  reference) and was caught only by rendering the page and reading it.

## Verification status

Everything through Phase D batch 4 is verified:

- `make -C latex book` succeeds; **683 pages**.
- makeindex: 2,400 entries accepted, 0 rejected, 0 warnings.
- No undefined references, no undefined control sequences, no duplicate labels, no doubled-
  backslash `\ref`, no hard-coded chapter numbers.
- `git diff --check` clean.
- Structural inventory: 12 Parts, 79 sequential chapter inputs/files, 8 appendix inputs/files;
  zero missing inputs, lost old labels, duplicate labels or hard-coded chapter numbers.
- Terminology/path pass: no obsolete CNA identifier, option, live selector assignment, or legacy
  renderer macro remains; all explicit `modules/...` file citations exist at the pin.
- Phase C's full 645-page pass remains green. Phase D batch 1 additionally rendered and reviewed
  every touched physical page, 194–303, as 11 contact sheets.
- Phase D batch 2 rendered and reviewed every touched physical page, 304–391, as 9 contact sheets.
- Phase D batch 3 rendered and reviewed every touched physical page, 392–455, as 8 contact sheets;
  the stride table, defect ledger, and audio equations were also inspected at full size.
- Phase D batch 4 rendered and reviewed every touched physical page, 456–523, as 8 contact sheets
  plus a tail sheet; high-risk component tables, link closures and include paths were inspected
  at full size, and the one detected overflow was fixed and re-rendered cleanly.

**No completed writing batch is pending PDF verification.** Continue with Chapters 55–63 and
follow the normal ~8–10 chapter batch rule.

## Environment notes

- **TeX Live** was absent at session start and was installed mid-session at the owner's
  direction. `latexmk`, `pdflatex`, `makeindex`, `pdftoppm` are all present and confirmed working.
- **No blocking questions for the project owner** at this time.
- Push status: local checkpoints are committed, but publishing them to `origin/next` was rejected
  by the external-action approval gate. Do not work around it; push only after explicit approval.

## The short version, if you read nothing else

Ten source-audit reports and the 42-family draw-path matrix are complete against pinned CNA
`7a64362e`. Phase B settled a 12-Part, 79-chapter, 8-appendix edition; Phase C put it on disk,
migrated terminology, selectors and paths, and verified all 645 pages. Phase D batches 1–4
rewrote Chapters 19–54 and verified the resulting 683-page book; Chapters 55–63 are next.
